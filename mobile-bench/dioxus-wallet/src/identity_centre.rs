//! Identity Centre Phase 1 — pragmatic linear page that wires the
//! four shipped wallet-core flows into the UI:
//!
//! 1. Bootstrap DID with VC keys ([`bootstrap_did_with_keys`]).
//! 2. OID4VP / SIOPv2 authenticate against a pasted `openid4vp://`
//!    URL ([`oid4vp_run_authentication`]).
//! 3. OID4VCI issue against a pasted `openid-credential-offer://`
//!    URL ([`oid4vci_run_issuance`]).
//! 4. List + self-verify cached VCs ([`self_verify_and_cache`]).
//!
//! The full Identity Centre design (carousel + FAB + nested sub-tabs)
//! from plan Tasks 30-36 is deferred to Phase 2; this module is the
//! minimum viable surface that lets an operator drive the QR-1 + KYC
//! + QR-2 contract against the running `IssuerDIDIT-mock` service
//! end-to-end. Paste-URL only — no camera scanner yet.
