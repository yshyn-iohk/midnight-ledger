//! Wallet worker thread — central serialiser for every heavy
//! chain operation the UI dispatches.
//!
//! Lives in a dedicated `std::thread` with an 8 MiB stack so the
//! state machines for `bootstrap_did_with_keys`, `run_authentication`,
//! `run_issuance`, `WalletStore::open`, etc. never have to be
//! materialised on the Chromium WebView dispatch thread's ~256 KiB
//! stack on Android. The UI side only ever sends a [`WorkMsg`] via
//! the worker's channel; results come back as [`WorkOutcome`] and
//! get routed back to the matching click handler through
//! [`router::OutcomeRouter`].
//!
//! Architecture rationale: see

/// Bundles the three-step `register-handler → send-message →
/// outcome-pump take` dance into one call that guarantees the
/// thread-affinity invariant of [`router`] holds. The previous
/// "register + send" pair was a footgun because:
///
/// - [`router::register`] writes the handler into a `thread_local!`
///   map keyed by `action_id`.
/// - The outcome pump's [`router::take`] reads from *its* thread's
///   `thread_local!` map.
/// - If those two calls execute on different threads, `take` finds
///   nothing and the worker's outcome is silently dropped
///   ("outcome dropped — no registered handler — see
///   worker/router.rs"). UI sits forever waiting for a notification
///   that's already been thrown away.
///
/// On Android (Pixel-Fold-API-35 emulator confirmed), a click
/// handler runs on the WebView dispatch thread (~ThreadId(4)),
/// while the outcome pump's `use_future` runs on the Dioxus task
/// pool (~ThreadId(2)). Same hazard on iOS sim. Wrapping the
/// register + send in [`dioxus::prelude::spawn`] runs them on the
/// task pool — matching where the pump's take eventually executes.
///
/// History: commit `fdba2182` fixed the bootstrap path with an
/// inline spawn wrap, `96c5214b` repeated the same fix for
/// OID4VCI + OID4VP, this helper landed afterwards to make the
/// fix unforgettable at every call site.
///
/// **Only [`router::register`] itself stays public** — for the
/// outcome-pump's smoke-test, which is already on the task pool by
/// construction. Every other path should use this `dispatch_action`.
