//! JS ↔ Rust bridge for the embedded WebView **plus** the
//! `BridgeState` aggregate that holds the shell's shared
//! application state (the wallet store handle, the metrics
//! pipeline, the wallet-worker handle, etc.). The two concerns
//! grew together because the bridge RPC methods need to look at
//! state, so they share a file — but `BridgeState` is the
//! interesting one architecturally.
//!
//! ## Bridge: JS ↔ Rust JSON-RPC channel
//!
//! Two responsibilities for the bridge half:
//!
//! 1. **Local proof-server.** On desktop we spawn
//!    `midnight-proof-server` on `127.0.0.1:0` at app startup. The JS
//!    bundle (midnight-did + deps) talks to it via the same HTTP
//!    protocol upstream packages already use, so we avoid bridging the
//!    proof preimage / proving key payload through the JSON-RPC channel.
//!    Android skips this — phase D wires up a remote URL fallback.
//!
//! 2. **JSON-RPC channel for everything else.** A long-lived
//!    Dioxus document JS runner accepts requests from JS via
//!    `dioxus.send(...)` and replies via `dioxus.recv()`. Methods are
//!    deliberately small — sign/derive operations the wallet keeps in
//!    Rust because the seed never leaves Rust. The JS side wraps them
//!    as `window.midnightWallet.<method>(...)` with promise semantics.
//!
//! ## BridgeState: shell-level application state
//!
//! `BridgeState` is a cheap-to-clone (Arc-wrapped fields)
//! aggregate that carries the shell's mid-flight state — the
//! handles every click handler, worker callback, and the
//! outcome-pump `use_future` reach into. Today it bundles three
//! distinct concerns:
//!
//! 1. **Persistence handles** — `store`, `active_wallet_id`,
//!    `controller_secrets`.
//! 2. **Observability** — `metrics`, `resource_probe`,
//!    `log_capture`.
//! 3. **Runtime infrastructure** — `worker`, `proof_server_url`.
//!
//! A clean future split would turn `BridgeState` into a façade
//! over `Persistence`/`Observability`/`Runtime` sub-aggregates;
//! the architectural payoff appears once we ship a second shell
//! (iOS, react-native) where the `Runtime` mix changes and the
//! Persistence/Observability layers stay common. Deferring the
//! mechanical split until that lands — see the audit doc
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-hex-architecture-audit.md`
//! §5.D for the rationale + entry-point inventory.

// ─── Sub-state groups ────────────────────────────────────────────
// `BridgeState` decomposes into three focused sub-states, one per
// concern. Each is cheap-to-clone (every field is `Arc<…>`) and
// rides as a value inside `BridgeState`. The previous flat layout
// mixed persistence, observability, and runtime infrastructure
// fields together; the audit doc
// (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-hex-architecture-audit.md`
// §5.D) flagged this as a deferred decomposition. The split is
// load-bearing once we ship a second shell where the `Runtime`
// mix differs and the `Persistence` / `Observability` halves stay
// common — until then it's a clarity refactor: each field is now
// reachable under its concern, and a reader can tell at a glance
// what surface a given click handler actually needs.
//
// The accessor methods on `BridgeState` stay as a façade so call
// sites (~31 of them across `app.rs`, `identity_centre.rs`,
// `worker/handlers.rs`) keep working with no edit. The one place
// the field path appears externally (`app.rs:9094`'s
// `bridge_state.controller_secrets.lock()`) is migrated to
// `bridge_state.persistence.controller_secrets.lock()` in this
// commit.
